The purpose of this project is to integrate a HTML file with our donuts.html Javascript file so that input and output occur in a browser window for a user to interact with.

For our input, we want the user to see a text input window that asks them if they wish to see  demand for donuts at various Top Pot locations. The input from the user should be a simple yes or no.

Our output should be the results of our script running in a clean readable format or a simple display message if the user opts for no.
